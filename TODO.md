# Project TODOs

- [ ] change source links to point to the Github repository instead of generating local source code HTML files
- [ ] inline README.md from components/mixins/utils into their docs (maybe can be done on the JSDoc side)
- [ ] use @mixes/@mixin to generate a dependency graph of mixins in each component
- [ ] figure out how to use custom tags and track CSS Parts assigned to each component
- [ ] Research [BetterDocs](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/better-docs) and their [Typescript Support](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/better-docs#typescript-support)
